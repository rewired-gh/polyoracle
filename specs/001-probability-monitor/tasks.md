## Dependencies & Execution Strategy

### User Story Completion Order

```
Phase 1: Setup (blocking)
   ↓
Phase 2: Foundational (blocking)
   ↓
Phase 3: US1 - Real-time Alerts (P1) ← MVP DELIVERABLE
   ↓
Phase 4: US2 - Customizable Config (P2)
   ↓
Phase 5: US4 - Watchlist Management (P2)
   ↓
Phase 6: US3 - Multi-Channel Architecture (P3)
   ↓
Phase 7: Polish
```

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Within Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- T013 (config tests), T018 (models tests), T028 (storage tests) can run in parallel after implementation tasks

**Within Phase 3 (US1)**:
- T034 (polymarket tests), T039 (monitor tests), T044 (telegram tests) can run in parallel after implementation tasks
- All test tasks marked with [P] can be parallelized

**Within Phase 7 (Polish)**:
- T063-T066 (deployment configs) can run in parallel
- T067-T068 (benchmarks) can run in parallel
- T071, T072, T073 (documentation) can run in parallel

### Independent Testing Strategy

Each user story phase includes:
1. Unit tests for individual components (marked with [P])
2. Integration tests for component interactions
3. Clear independent test criteria at story level

**US1 Independent Test**: End-to-end integration test (T049) validates complete flow from polling to notification delivery

**US2 Independent Test**: Configuration reload test (T053) validates parameter changes take effect immediately

**US4 Independent Test**: Watchlist filtering test (T057) validates only watched events trigger notifications

**US3 Independent Test**: Dispatcher test (T062) validates multi-channel architecture works correctly

## Task Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 75
- **Setup Phase**: 8 tasks
- **Foundational Phase**: 20 tasks
- **US1 (P1) Phase**: 21 tasks (MVP)
- **US2 (P2) Phase**: 4 tasks
- **US4 (P2) Phase**: 4 tasks
- **US3 (P3) Phase**: 5 tasks
- **Polish Phase**: 13 tasks

**Parallelizable Tasks**: 25 tasks marked with [P]

**Test Tasks**: 13 explicit test tasks + integration tests per story

---

## MVP Scope Recommendation

**Minimum Viable Product**: Complete Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 (US1)

This delivers:
- ✅ Polymarket API integration with automatic polling
- ✅ Probability change detection with configurable threshold
- ✅ Telegram notifications for top k events
- ✅ In-memory storage with persistence
- ✅ YAML configuration
- ✅ Basic deployment (binary + Docker + systemd)

**Estimated MVP Tasks**: 49 tasks (Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3)

## Implementation Notes

### Constitution Compliance

All tasks adhere to constitutional principles:
- **Simplicity**: Single-user mode, file-based config, in-memory storage
- **Go Language**: Idiomatic Go patterns, standard library preference
- **Robust Dependencies**: Only 2 external dependencies (Viper, Telegram Bot API)
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests for sustainable feedback loop
- **Code Quality**: Clear naming, explicit error handling, focused functions

### Testing Strategy

Per user requirement "write decent amount of tests (including unit tests)":
- Every package has unit tests (*_test.go files)
- Table-driven tests for multiple scenarios
- Integration tests for end-to-end validation
- Benchmarks for performance-critical paths (storage, change detection)

### Deployment Readiness

Tasks T063-T066 ensure deployment is "simple, elegant, and robust":
- Single binary executable
- Docker container with multi-stage build
- systemd service for daemon operation
- Clear documentation in README.md

## Next Steps

1. Execute tasks sequentially starting with T001
2. Complete Phase 1 and Phase 2 before starting user stories
3. Deliver MVP after completing Phase 3 (US1)
4. Gather user feedback before continuing with US2, US4, US3
5. Polish and optimize in Phase 7 before production deployment

**Suggested Command**: `/speckit.implement` to begin execution
