# Poly Oracle Test Configuration
# 15-minute polling for testing, targeting 0-3 events per cycle.
# Single interval (poll_interval) drives: polling, detection window, persistence.

monitor:
  # Lower sensitivity (0.3) for 15m window - changes are smaller
  # min_score = 0.3^2 × 0.05 = 0.0045
  # At this threshold, ~3-5% probability moves can pass the quality bar
