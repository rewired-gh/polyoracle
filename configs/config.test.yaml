# Poly Oracle Test Configuration
# Sensitive configuration for end-to-end testing
#
# This configuration is optimized for testing - it will generate
# notifications frequently to verify the system works end-to-end.
#
# DO NOT use for production - too sensitive, will generate noise.
# Based on analysis: monitors ~80-100 events, expects 8-15 alerts/hour

# Polymarket API configuration
polymarket:
  gamma_api_url: "https://gamma-api.polymarket.com"
  clob_api_url: "https://clob.polymarket.com"
  poll_interval: 15m                                 # Poll every 15 minutes (matches production)
  categories:                                        # Test with all relevant categories
    - geopolitics
    - tech
    - finance
    - world
  # Low volume thresholds for testing - captures more events
  volume_24hr_min: 1000.0       # $1K minimum
  volume_1wk_min: 5000.0        # $5K weekly
  volume_1mo_min: 10000.0       # $10K monthly
  volume_filter_or: true        # OR logic (union)
  limit: 1000                   # Fetch many events
  timeout: 30s

# Monitoring behavior configuration - very sensitive for testing
monitor:
  threshold: 0.04        # 2% change (very sensitive)
  window: 15m            # 15-minute window (matches poll interval)
  top_k: 5               # Show top 5 events for testing
  enabled: true

# Telegram notification configuration
telegram:
  bot_token: "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"  # Get from @BotFather on Telegram
  chat_id: "YOUR_CHAT_ID_HERE"      # Get from @userinfobot on Telegram
  enabled: true                     # Enable Telegram notifications

# Storage and persistence configuration
storage:
  max_events: 1000000                       # Maximum events to track in memory
  max_snapshots_per_event: 288              # 24 hours of 5-minute snapshots (288 = 24*12)
  max_file_size_mb: 500                     # Maximum persistence file size in MB
  persistence_interval: 15m                 # Save frequently for testing
  file_path: ""                             # Empty = use OS tmp dir
  data_dir: ""                              # Empty = use OS tmp dir

# Logging configuration - debug level for testing
logging:
  level: "debug"    # Debug level for detailed testing output
  format: "text"    # Text format for easier reading during tests

# Environment variables can override any value:
# POLY_ORACLE_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_token
# POLY_ORACLE_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id
# POLY_ORACLE_MONITOR_THRESHOLD=0.01
