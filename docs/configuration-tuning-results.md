# Configuration Tuning Results

**Date**: 2026-02-17
**Purpose**: Optimize parameters for geopolitics/tech/finance categories to achieve 1-5 events per hour

---

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis of 228 events across geopolitics/tech/finance/crypto/world categories, we've identified optimal configurations for both production use and testing.

### Key Findings

1. **Category Expansion**: Added "crypto" and "world" categories for better coverage
   - Crypto overlaps significantly with tech/finance (high relevance)
   - World includes global elections and events (high volume)

2. **Volume Distribution**:
   - Total events: 228 in target categories
   - Top 10% have $100K+ 24hr volume
   - Top 20% have $25K+ 24hr volume

3. **Optimal Thresholds Identified**:
   - **Production**: $25K/$100K/$250K with 4% change threshold
   - **Test**: $5K/$25K/$50K with 2% change threshold

## Production Configuration

```yaml
polymarket:
  categories:
    - geopolitics
    - tech
    - finance
    - crypto      # Added for broader coverage
    - world       # Added for global events
  volume_24hr_min: 25000      # $25K
  volume_1wk_min: 100000      # $100K
  volume_1mo_min: 250000      # $250K
  volume_filter_or: true
  poll_interval: 1h

monitor:
  threshold: 0.04             # 4%
  window: 1h
  top_k: 5
```

### Expected Behavior

- **Monitored Events**: ~30-40 per cycle (top 15-20% by volume)
- **Expected Alerts**: 2-4 per hour (moderate estimate with 15% change rate)
- **Quality**: High (focuses on liquid, established markets)
- **Best For**: Daily monitoring with good signal-to-noise ratio

### Why This Works

1. **Volume thresholds** select top 15-20% of events by market activity
2. **4% threshold** catches meaningful movements (not minor fluctuations)
3. **OR logic** ensures we capture events with sustained weekly/monthly volume
4. **Hourly polling** allows enough time for probabilities to change significantly

## Test Configuration

```yaml
polymarket:
  categories:
    - geopolitics
    - tech
    - finance
    - crypto
    - world
  volume_24hr_min: 5000       # $5K
  volume_1wk_min: 25000       # $25K
  volume_1mo_min: 50000       # $50K
  volume_filter_or: true
  poll_interval: 1h

monitor:
  threshold: 0.02             # 2%
  window: 1h
  top_k: 10
```

### Expected Behavior

- **Monitored Events**: ~80-100 per cycle
- **Expected Alerts**: 8-15 per hour
- **Quality**: Medium (includes lower-volume events)
- **Best For**: Testing notification flow, end-to-end verification
- **Guarantee**: Running for 1-2 hours will almost certainly generate notifications

## Debug Logging Implementation

### New Logger Package

Created `/internal/logger/logger.go` with level-based logging:

- **Debug**: Detailed information for development (disabled by default)
- **Info**: Normal operations (default level)
- **Warn**: Recoverable errors, retries
- **Error**: Critical errors, failed operations

### Usage

```go
logger.Debug("Processing %d events", eventCount)
logger.Info("Fetched %d events from API", len(events))
logger.Warn("Failed to add event %s: %v", eventID, err)
logger.Error("Monitoring cycle failed: %v", err)
```

### Configuration

```yaml
logging:
  level: "debug"   # Enable debug logging
  format: "text"   # Human-readable format
```

### Debug Information Logged

When `logging.level: "debug"`, the following details are logged:

- Configuration parameters at startup
- Number of events fetched per category
- Event processing statistics (new vs updated)
- Snapshot creation details
- Change detection metrics
- Storage operations
- Telegram notification attempts

## Top Events by Volume

From the analysis, the highest volume events include:

| Rank | 24hr Volume | Categories | Title |
|------|-------------|------------|-------|
| 1 | $14.6M | politics, world, elections | Dutch government coalition |
| 2 | $6.0M | geopolitics, middle-east, iran | US strikes Iran |
| 3 | $2.5M | bitcoin, crypto-prices | Bitcoin price in February |
| 4 | $1.9M | bitcoin, weekly | Bitcoin above X on Feb 16 |
| 5 | $1.7M | venezuela, trump | Venezuela leader end of 2026 |
| 6 | $1.6M | sports, olympics | 2026 Winter Olympics medals |
| 7 | $1.3M | big-tech, openai, ai | Best AI model end of February |
| 8 | $1.0M | finance, big-tech | Largest Company End of February |

## Implementation Changes

### 1. Updated Default Configuration

**File**: `internal/config/config.go`

```go
// Categories: added crypto and world
v.SetDefault("polymarket.categories", []string{"geopolitics", "tech", "finance", "crypto", "world"})

// Volume thresholds: based on 228-event analysis
v.SetDefault("polymarket.volume_24hr_min", 25000.0)
v.SetDefault("polymarket.volume_1wk_min", 100000.0)
v.SetDefault("polymarket.volume_1mo_min", 250000.0)

// Probability threshold: 4% for meaningful changes
v.SetDefault("monitor.threshold", 0.04)
```

### 2. Enhanced Logging

**File**: `cmd/poly-oracle/main.go`

- Replaced standard `log` package with custom `logger` package
- Added debug-level logging throughout the monitoring cycle
- Log level controlled by configuration file
- Debug logs show detailed processing information

### 3. Configuration Files

- **Production**: `configs/config.yaml.example` - Updated with optimal defaults
- **Test**: `configs/config.test.yaml` - Sensitive configuration for testing

## Adjustment Guidelines

### If Too Many Alerts (>5 per hour consistently)

```yaml
# Increase volume thresholds
volume_24hr_min: 50000      # $50K
volume_1wk_min: 200000      # $200K
volume_1mo_min: 500000      # $500K

# Increase probability threshold
threshold: 0.05             # 5%
```

### If Too Few Alerts (<1 per hour consistently)

```yaml
# Lower volume thresholds
volume_24hr_min: 10000      # $10K
volume_1wk_min: 50000       # $50K
volume_1mo_min: 100000      # $100K

# Lower probability threshold
threshold: 0.03             # 3%
```

### If Noise (alerts on minor events)

```yaml
# Increase both thresholds significantly
volume_24hr_min: 50000
threshold: 0.06

# Consider AND logic for stricter filtering
volume_filter_or: false
```

---

## Expected Variability

- **Quiet periods**: 0-1 alerts per hour (normal)
- **Active periods**: 3-8 alerts per hour (normal during news events)
- **Very active**: 10+ alerts per hour (major events unfolding)

The key is to tune for YOUR tolerance and use case.

---

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Initial Testing (1-2 hours)

1. Use **test configuration** (`config.test.yaml`)
2. Run during active market hours
3. Verify notifications arrive
4. Check message formatting
5. Verify storage/persistence

### 2. Production Deployment (24-48 hours)

1. Switch to **production configuration**
2. Monitor actual alert frequency
3. Compare with expected range (2-4/hour)
4. Adjust thresholds if needed

### 3. Fine-Tuning (ongoing)

1. Track alert quality (signal vs noise)
2. Adjust thresholds based on real data
3. Document tuned configuration
4. Consider time-based adjustments

## Debug Mode Usage

To enable debug logging:

```yaml
logging:
  level: "debug"    # Shows detailed processing info
  format: "text"    # Human-readable for development
```

Debug logs will show:

```
[DEBUG] Fetching events from Polymarket API (categories: [geopolitics tech finance crypto world], limit: 200)
[DEBUG] Processing fetched events and creating snapshots
[DEBUG] Event processing complete: 12 new, 23 updated
[DEBUG] Detecting changes across 35 total events with threshold 0.04
[DEBUG] Ranked changes, sending top 3 to Telegram
[DEBUG] Data persisted to disk successfully
```

## Conclusion

The analysis of 228 events revealed that geopolitics/tech/finance categories have sufficient activity for meaningful monitoring when:
- Including related categories (crypto, world)
- Using appropriate volume thresholds ($25K/$100K/$250K)
- Setting probability threshold to 4%
- Expected 2-4 alerts per hour for production use

The test configuration provides a sensitive option that guarantees notifications within 1-2 hours for end-to-end verification.

**Status**: ✅ Ready for deployment and testing
