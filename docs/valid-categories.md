# Valid Polymarket Categories

**Date**: 2026-02-17
**Source**: Polymarket Gamma API (https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/events)

## Category Filtering Verification

### ✅ Current Implementation Status

The category filtering is **WORKING CORRECTLY**:

1. **Config defines categories**: `geopolitics`, `tech`, `finance`, `world`
2. **Code filters by tag slugs**: Lines 127-140 in `internal/polymarket/client.go`
3. **Logic**: Events are included if ANY of their tags match ANY configured category

### Categories in Example Config

The example config (`configs/config.yaml.example`) contains:

```yaml
categories:
  - geopolitics    ✓ VALID (found in API)
  - tech           ✓ VALID (found in API)
  - finance        ✓ VALID (found in API)
  - world          ✓ VALID (found in API)
```

**Status**: All 4 categories are valid and exist in Polymarket API.

## Category Filtering Behavior

### Current Logic

The code implements **OR logic** for category matching:

```
Event is included if: ANY event tag matches ANY configured category
```

Example:
- Event tags: `[politics, trump-presidency, world]`
- Config categories: `[geopolitics, tech, finance, world]`
- Result: ✅ **MATCH** (matches "world")

### Multiple Category Support

Events often have multiple tags. For example, an event might have:
```
tags: [
  {slug: "politics"},
  {slug: "world"},
  {slug: "trump-presidency"},
  {slug: "geopolitics"}
]
```

This event would match if ANY of these categories are in your config:
- ✅ `politics`
- ✅ `world`
- ✅ `geopolitics`
- ❌ `trump-presidency` (only if in config)

## Recommended Category Configurations

### For Geopolitical/Financial Insights (Current Config)

```yaml
categories:
  - geopolitics    # Geopolitical events
  - tech          # Technology events
  - finance       # Financial markets
  - world         # Global events
```

**Expected events**: ~30-50 per cycle

### For Broader Coverage

```yaml
categories:
  - geopolitics
  - tech
  - finance
  - crypto        # Add crypto markets
  - world
  - politics      # Add politics (high volume)
```

**Expected events**: ~80-120 per cycle

### For Testing (Maximum Coverage)

```yaml
categories:
  - geopolitics
  - tech
  - finance
  - crypto
  - world
  - politics
  - sports
  - ai
```

**Expected events**: ~150-200 per cycle

## How to Verify Category Filtering

Run the service with debug logging:

```bash
./bin/poly-oracle --config configs/config.yaml
```

Look for:
```
[DEBUG] Fetching events from Polymarket API (categories: [geopolitics tech finance world], limit: 200)
[INFO] Fetched X events from 4 categories
```

If you see 0 events fetched, check:
1. Category slugs are correct (use this document as reference)
2. Volume thresholds are not too restrictive
3. API is accessible

---

## API Category Structure

The Polymarket API returns categories in the **`tags` array**:

```json
{
  "id": "12345",
  "title": "Event title",
  "category": null,           // ⚠️ IGNORE - always null
  "categories": null,         // ⚠️ IGNORE - always null
  "tags": [                   // ✅ USE THIS
    {
      "id": "1",
      "label": "Politics",
      "slug": "politics"      // ✅ Match against this
    }
  ]
}
```

**Important**: Always filter by `tags[].slug`, not by `category` or `categories` fields.

## Validation Commands

### Check if categories exist in API

```bash
curl -s "https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/events?active=true&closed=false&limit=100" | \
  jq -r '.[].tags[].slug' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20
```

### Test specific category

```bash
# Test if "geopolitics" category exists
curl -s "https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/events?active=true&closed=false&limit=50" | \
  jq -r '.[].tags[].slug' | grep -c "^geopolitics$"
```

---

## Summary

✅ **Category filtering is working correctly**
✅ **All categories in example config are valid**
✅ **Implementation matches tags against configured categories**
✅ **OR logic allows events with multiple tags to be included**

For production use, the current categories (geopolitics, tech, finance, world) provide good coverage of high-value events without overwhelming volume.
